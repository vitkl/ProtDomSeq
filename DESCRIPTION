Description: This package facilitates work with InterPro protein domains and 
    FASTA Sequences from UniProt database. 
    You can used it to read InterPro GFF3 output, combine with signature type
    annotations,filter, combine domain positions by InterPro ID (useful when matching
    signatures from InterPro member databases differ), parse and use InterPro domain hierarchy.
